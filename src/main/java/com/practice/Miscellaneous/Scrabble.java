/*Scrabble
Misa is playing scrabble with her smaller sister. In this game, each tile contains a lowercase letter written on it.
Her smaller sister has a number of tiles and she gives them to Misa so that she can form a word using all of them.
Count how many words can be formed from the given tiles (the words may or may not make sense).

Input Format

The first line of input contains t which gives the number of test cases. Each test case contains one line which contains a
string of letters that denote the tiles Misa’s younger sister gives to her.

Output Format

The output contains t lines where each line contains the number of words that can be formed from the given tiles using all of them.

Constraints

1<=t<=10000

2<=n<=1000, where n denotes the number of tiles given to Misa by her sister.

Sample Input

3
cat
tiger
aab
Sample Output

6
120
3
Explanation

For the first test case, the tiles are ‘c’,’a’ and ‘t’. From these 3 letters, the following words can be formed are act, atc, cat, cta, tac, tca.

Therefore, total number of words that can be formed from these tiles is 6.

Similarly for the second test case. For the third test case, the unique words that can be formed are aab, aba and baa. So the output is 3.*/
